# Threadit Clone – Backend

A fully functional **Reddit-style backend API** built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT authentication**.  
The API supports core Reddit-like features such as posts, comments, voting, communities, and user authentication.  
API testing was performed using **Postman**, and unit tests were implemented with **Jest**.
